        <p class="about-me-body">
            As a software developer, I believe it's
            important to continue learning and
            keep up with new technologies being
            introduced to the industry. By staying
            engaged with fellow alumnus of Codeup,
            I've been able to expand my knowledge
            and reaffirm my existing skills through
            different scenarios. Every day is a new challenge
            to find creative, innovative solutions
            when collaborating with students on
            their projects. I wish to contribute my
            growing knowledge of software
            development to a great team and
            become a valuable asset to a company.
